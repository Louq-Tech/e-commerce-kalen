# Kalen Health Care

## Explanations on the system

### UI/UX Design Principles
1. Focusing on simplicity -  The dashboard uses a clean, minimalistic design with clear typography and color coding
2. Visual Hierachy - Important data (like critical vitals) are emphasized via size, color or positioning at the top.
3. Consistency - The use of consistent spacing, colors and UI components to reduce cognitive load.
4. Responsiveness - The dashboard layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, mobile) switching from multi column to horizontal view.

## Framework used
- **React** -
  I chose **React** for building this healthcare dashboard because of its strong component stacking architecture, which allows me to break down the UI into reusable, self contained pieces. This approach makes development faster and the code easier to maintain and scale.
